<a  class="un" href="https://www.epicypher.com/resources/protocols/">CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag protocols</a> have transformed the epigenetics field by offering faster, more accessible alternatives to traditional <a  class="un" href="https://www.epicypher.com/resources/blogchromatin-mapping-basics-chipseq/">ChIP-seq</a> chromatin mapping assays. However, as with any new technology, CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag protocols come with a learning curve. User questions about CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag sample prep, antibody validation, assay controls, and data analysis need to be addressed for best results. 
</p>
<p>
At EpiCypher, we’ve spent years identifying and resolving these pain points so we can proactively provide researchers with the tools and guidance to successfully implement CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag. From validated reagents to expert support, we are committed to ensuring that users unlock the full potential of these cutting-edge technologies.
</p>

<p>
In 2023, we introduced our <a class="un" href="https://support.epicypher.com/">Tech Support Center</a> to centralize answers to common questions about the CUT&RUN protocol. We have recently expanded the Tech Support Center to cover CUT&Tag-related inquiries, as well as other questions we increasingly see customers asking—like how to make <a  class="un" href="https://support.epicypher.com/docs/facs-cells-cut-and-run/">FACS-isolated cells compatible with CUT&RUN</a>. Below, check out some common pain points our users encounter with CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag technologies, and read the linked Tech Support Center articles for expert-backed guidance.

<h2>
  <strong>Common challenges in CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag assays</strong>
</h2>

<p>
CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag protocols are user-friendly, especially compared to more labor-intensive ChIP-seq assays. But no assay is perfect! Some common areas where problems arise include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sample prep</strong>: The better the starting cell sample, the better your CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag sequencing data will be. Issues can include confirming cell viability and integrity, optimizing Digitonin concentration, and performing cross-linking correctly.</li>

<li><strong>Antibody selection and validation</strong>: The success of these assays is highly dependent on antibody quality. But what makes a good CUT&RUN or CUT&Tag antibody?</li>

<li><strong>Assay controls</strong>: What controls are required? Applying and interpreting appropriate CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag controls can be difficult, but they are essential for assay success.</li>

<li><strong>Data analysis</strong>: Processing CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag sequencing data, analyzing control metrics, and understanding with background signal are key steps that can require specialized guidance.</li>
</ul>
