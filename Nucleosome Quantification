          In order to report the concentration of recombinant nucleosomes,
          EpiCypher measures the absorbance of the nucleosome at 260nm. The
          observed signal is attributed to double stranded DNA (dsDNA)
          absorbance. Using a standard, generally accepted conversion factor of
          1 Abs = 50 ng - cm/μL for dsDNA, this absorbance is converted to a
          concentration (ng/μL) using the Beer-Lambert law. As both the DNA and
          histone octamer components are fully defined in the case of
          recombinant nucleosomes, the computed concentration of DNA is
          converted to concentration of nucleosome using the respective
          molecular weights of these components.
